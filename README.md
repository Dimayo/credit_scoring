#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Objective
<p>The purpose of this project is to create one of the models for assessing credit risk - predicting the client's default on a loan. Default â€” non-payment of interest on a loan or bonds, non-repayment of a loan within a certain time t. Usually, default is considered accomplished if the client has not made a payment on the loan within 90 days.</p> <p>The model allows a bank or other credit institution to assess the current risk on any loans and credit products issued and to prevent the client from defaulting on credit obligations with a higher degree of probability. Thus, the bank is less at risk of incurring losses.</p>

### Methods Used
* Data preparation
* Exploratory analysis
* Class balancing
* Feature selection
* Data visualization
* Machine learning

## Project Description
The data contains information about various attributes of borrowers and credit products: about customers who already have loans, their credit history and financial indicators. Each entry in the dataset represents one specific loan product issued to a specific borrower. The quality metric of the model to use is roc-auc.
